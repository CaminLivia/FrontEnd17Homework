          The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to
          the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed
          primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell and
          superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog
          for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
          around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a
          popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health
          problems.
